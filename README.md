### Notice
Artemis 2 is in development. In the meanwhile I'm no longer supporting Artemis 1.x, sorry!

Some things I have planned for 2.0
- Completely overhauled UI
- Deep intergration with DarthAffe's [RGB.NET](https://github.com/DarthAffe/RGB.NET) (meaning more devices!)
- Profiles will no longer be bound to a specific keyboard but will work on any keyboard
- Layers will be assigned to keys accurately like done in per example Corsair's CUE thanks to RGB.NET
- Instead of the built-in game support Artemis currently offers there will be plugins that add support for games, new layers, effects and more
- The plugin system will replace the current idea of having a scripting engine and will be in multiple languages (these will be in the form of plugins themselves)
- I'll include some plugins by default to support most of the games Artemis currently supports (I might drop some games that don't work well/are too much work to maintain)
- There will be a workshop to share plugins, profiles and even layers. This workshop will be part of an Artemis website

Much of this is subject to change and will take a while to create but it'll leave us with a much better platform to create a community around :smiley:
