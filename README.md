For online games we greatly prefer to use an official API, since memory reading is frowned upon by anti-cheat sofware.

### Profile editor
For its games Artemis uses a custom-made layer system. For each game you can make one or more profiles consisting of layers that interact with the game. Layers can contain a color, multiple colors, animations and even GIFs!

All this is done in the profile editor. For each game and keyboard we provide a default profile, but you're free to duplicate and modify this, or create one entirely from scratch.

The screenshot above shows the profile editor as it would appear for CS:GO. The preview shows a rough indication of how the layers will look and allows dragging and resizing. A realtime preview is also shown on the keyboard.

Layers can be reordered or organized into folders by dragging and dropping them. 
There are multiple layer types

 - Keyboard layer
 - Keyboard GIF layer (Yes, allows you to display a GIF on your keyboard!)
 - Mouse layer
 - Headset layer
 - Folder

A keyboard layer's appearance is controlled by its brush. Brushes can be created using the color picker. For more examples, see the demo profile included in the 'Windows Profile' effect.

The above screenshot shows a rainbow gradient made with the color picker.

A layer's properties can be adjusted to react to ingame events and variables. This screenshot shows how conditions can be attached to a layer, in this case this layer is only enabled when the player has more than 14.000 ingame cash.

Besides adding display conditions to layers, it is also possible to base certain properties on what is happening ingame.

In this example, the layer is configured to become smaller when the player loses health. The layer's height is based on the percentage of health left, with the maximum health being 100, shrinking downwards as the health decreases.

To keep things interesting, layers can also be configured to use animations. Here's a preview of the demo profile showing a few of the things possible.
